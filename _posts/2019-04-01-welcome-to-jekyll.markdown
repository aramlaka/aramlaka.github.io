I started the blog as a way to showcase my programming prowess.
Here is what 4 years of university and 1 year of work experience have netted me.

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
  print(f"Hi, {name}")
end

print_hi('Akhil') #=> prints 'Hi, Akhil' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

I see this as a source of motivation and things to come. 
When I have something interesting to say I will say it here!
